            <h2>🌟 About the NotesApp Service</h2>
            <p>The NotesApp is a lightweight, high-availability service built on a **Serverless Architecture** (AWS API Gateway + AWS Lambda + DynamoDB). Its primary goal is to provide a reliable, low-cost platform for users to manage their personal notes.</p>
            
            <h3>Core Functionality (CRUD)</h3>
            <ul class="success-list">
                <li>**Create (POST /create):** Users can save a new note with a unique ID, title, and content.</li>
                <li>**Read (GET /get):** Users can retrieve all notes associated with their user ID.</li>
                <li>**Update (PUT /update):** Users can modify the title and/or content of an existing note.</li>
                <li>**Delete (DELETE /delete):** Users can permanently remove a note from the system.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>🚧 Major Complications Faced During Deployment (Today)</h2>
            <p>The transition from local code development to a live, production-ready environment involved debugging several complex, layered issues across different AWS services. Solving these problems confirmed the system's stability.</p>

            <ul class="problem-list">
                <li>
                    <strong>Deployment Failure ("Message Not Found")</strong>
                    <p>The initial issue was the **API Gateway** failing to recognize the application endpoint. This was due to using the incorrect deployment command (`apigateway`) for an **HTTP API** (which requires `apigatewayv2 create-stage`) and incorrect API ID mapping. This was solved by using the correct CLI commands and ensuring the `/live` stage was properly deployed to the correct `xirdjkmiuk` resource.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Persistent Internal Server Errors (500)</strong>
                    <p>Once deployed, the Lambda function crashed on `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations, returning a generic 500 error. This was caused by **unstable Python code logic** regarding Boto3, specifically the strict **`ConditionExpression`** (like `attribute_exists`) and faulty error handling. This required multiple rounds of code refactoring to ensure stability.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Silent Crashes (No CloudWatch Logs)</strong>
                    <p>The final, most difficult bug involved a **`500` error with no log output**, indicating a crash before the function handler could even start. This pointed to an **environmental issue**. We solved this by increasing the Lambda's **Timeout** to prevent cold-start crashes and by **re-linking the API Gateway integrations** to clear stale connection data.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Final "Not Found" Error on Delete</strong>
                    <p>The last bug was a functional error (`Note Not Found`) on the `DELETE` operation. This was resolved by meticulously **debugging the data flow** and confirming the item existed and that the API Gateway integration for the DELETE route was re-attached, clearing any final configuration errors.</p>
                </li>
