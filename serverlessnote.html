            <h2>🌟 About the NotesApp Service</h2>
            <p>The NotesApp is a lightweight, high-availability service built on a **Serverless Architecture** (AWS API Gateway + AWS Lambda + DynamoDB). Its primary goal is to provide a reliable, low-cost platform for users to manage their personal notes.</p>
            
            <h3>Core Functionality (CRUD)</h3>
            <ul class="success-list">
                <li>**Create (POST /create):** Users can save a new note with a unique ID, title, and content.</li>
                <li>**Read (GET /get):** Users can retrieve all notes associated with their user ID.</li>
                <li>**Update (PUT /update):** Users can modify the title and/or content of an existing note.</li>
                <li>**Delete (DELETE /delete):** Users can permanently remove a note from the system.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>🚧 Major Complications Faced During Deployment (Today)</h2>
            <p>The transition from local code development to a live, production-ready environment involved debugging several complex, layered issues across different AWS services. Solving these problems confirmed the system's stability.</p>

            <ul class="problem-list">
                <li>
                    <strong>Deployment Failure ("Message Not Found")</strong>
                    <p>The initial issue was the **API Gateway** failing to recognize the application endpoint. This was due to using the incorrect deployment command (`apigateway`) for an **HTTP API** (which requires `apigatewayv2 create-stage`) and incorrect API ID mapping. This was solved by using the correct CLI commands and ensuring the `/live` stage was properly deployed to the correct `xirdjkmiuk` resource.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Persistent Internal Server Errors (500)</strong>
                    <p>Once deployed, the Lambda function crashed on `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations, returning a generic 500 error. This was caused by **unstable Python code logic** regarding Boto3, specifically the strict **`ConditionExpression`** (like `attribute_exists`) and faulty error handling. This required multiple rounds of code refactoring to ensure stability.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Silent Crashes (No CloudWatch Logs)</strong>
                    <p>The final, most difficult bug involved a **`500` error with no log output**, indicating a crash before the function handler could even start. This pointed to an **environmental issue**. We solved this by increasing the Lambda's **Timeout** to prevent cold-start crashes and by **re-linking the API Gateway integrations** to clear stale connection data.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Final "Not Found" Error on Delete</strong>
                    <p>The last bug was a functional error (`Note Not Found`) on the `DELETE` operation. This was resolved by meticulously **debugging the data flow** and confirming the item existed and that the API Gateway integration for the DELETE route was re-attached, clearing any final configuration errors.</p>
                </li>
                 <strong>Final "Still a headache</strong>
                    <p>Still a headache, I gave myself a days breathing space, to revisit and do a web page. With the help of the Ai, it started to show me to practice setting up basic elements of the webpage and for me to test it. Gradually I found more and more errors. So went back to API Gateway and Lambda and start to research back into the problems. I started with a REST API and getting ai to show me code that easy could set this up in AWS CLI. And kept back and forth with Lambda. With my python code, We had problems with using the new python 3.14 Which is a new relative update at this time in late November. I think the conclusion was used an early version of 3.12 and then zip the python code and upload to Lambda. I kept on getting internal server errors of 500. So know what a coder has to go through, in case the code breaks. I even upated the security settings in the API gateway so that could talk to the Dynambo DB, and used a tool in VS code to test the API. Kept going back and forth with AI again as the code extension kept on giving me more visual clues to say whats wrong. The website webproject.html is on the main screen by the way. There is still limitations to this. That you have to create a note first of all, and this generates a number to the rest of the three other options. Update, Delete, and get notes. I am going to goto the project. But I believe my natural Aim is to do the architect solution associate course and complete that. Coding can be tedious and repetiive to get it working, I spent probably a good day and half trying to get the code right. I think the get function is not working. The delete and create options do definately work. I will update when and as when I can. Persistance and perserverance are definately key qualities for a programmer.  </p>
