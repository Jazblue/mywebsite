  <h1>My AWS Learning Journey</h1>

  <p>I embarked on an AWS project to host a static website using <span class="highlight">S3</span>, <span class="highlight">CodePipeline</span>, and <span class="highlight">CodeBuild</span>. It was a journey full of trial and error, learning, and ultimately, success.</p>

  <h2>The YAML Template Struggle</h2>
  <p>Initially, I used a YAML template to set up the pipeline. However, it kept failing because the <span class="highlight">Deploy stage</span> to S3 was missing. I went back and forth trying to resolve the errors, reading docs, and testing configurations. Finally, I managed to add the proper deploy stage, and the pipeline ran successfully.</p>

  <h2>The HTML Loading Issue</h2>
  <p>After deployment, the website wouldn’t open correctly. The HTML file would download instead of displaying. I checked the permissions, unblocked public access, and eventually discovered that the <span class="highlight">Content-Type metadata</span> was incorrect. I deleted the file and re-uploaded it with the correct <code>text/html</code> content type. Finally, the page rendered perfectly.</p>

  <h2>Manual Hosting and Learning</h2>
  <p>To solidify my understanding, I also hosted the site manually on AWS using S3, CloudFront, Route 53, and ACM. This allowed me to apply everything I learned about static hosting, secure certificates, and CDN configuration.</p>

  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>This project was a true learning experience. I gained hands-on skills with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>CI/CD using CodePipeline and CodeBuild</li>
    <li>S3 static hosting and metadata handling</li>
    <li>Debugging pipeline and deployment errors</li>
    <li>Manual vs automated Infrastructure-as-Code deployment</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Overall, it was a challenging but extremely rewarding project.</p>
